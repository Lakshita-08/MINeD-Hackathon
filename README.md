# MINeD-Hackathon

#Project Title - Applied ML for manufacturing Industry's problem

#Problem Statement - We have to develop a Image processing Algorithm for Identification of Week number on Cement Bag on a running belt, color of Character is Black , Cement Bag color may be black , White, Green, Yellow. In this algorithm if we found any bag without week no , we have put an entry in SQL database (Which will be utilized for stopping the Belt).

Project that detects whether information like batch number , MRP is printed on a cement bag or not

#installation in anaconda
conda install OpenCV 

It first do image processing and then we have train and test set to classify the image.
CLassification is such that if we get 1 then the information is printed and if we get 0 then it is not printed.
